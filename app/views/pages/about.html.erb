The proposal of this website is to show a little more about my work and capabilities, and also, it’s a form to keep up with my knowledge, studying and applying the all the forms of knowledge to produce a high quality of work (in this case code).</p>

            <p>A little more about myself as a person, I like animes, games, TV series and also, I like to learn the new frameworks to keep up with the market and to learn new things to apply into my personal projects. My main interests are Machine Learning, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, IOS/Android Dev. And currently I’m focused to learn more about React and Angular and to hone my skills as a back-end developer and learn more about front-end development, so I can become a Full Stacker Developer.</p>
